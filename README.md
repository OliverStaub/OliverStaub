## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a CS Student working as a Software Dev


I like to work on projects to reduce my screen time :)

- I built an Android OS Fork stripped from its browser and App Store over here: https://github.com/LudditeOS
- Currently I am working on a Safari Browser Extension to stop Doomscrolling: https://github.com/OliverStaub/ScrollStop
